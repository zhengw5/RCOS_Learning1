Learning how to make an issue and post it
When you issue a bug or piece of code, it will be posted and then other team members can pull it up and try to fix it
I was learning git commands through a pdf I had found and I also learned to clone a repository, add a remote, and how to actually use git bash (git clone, git add remote,
git remove remote, git remote -v, cd "file link on file explorer")
